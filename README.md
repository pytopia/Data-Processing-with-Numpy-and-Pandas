# Data Processing with Numpy and Pandas

Data processing is a critical skill in today's data-driven world, and NumPy and Pandas are two of the most widely used Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. This course will provide an in-depth introduction to the NumPy and Pandas libraries and their use in data processing.

In this course, you will learn how to use NumPy and Pandas to read, clean, manipulate, and analyze data from a variety of sources. You will learn the fundamental data structures of NumPy and Pandas and how to use them to perform operations like filtering, sorting, merging, grouping, and aggregating data.

You will also learn how to handle missing data and perform basic statistical analysis.

Throughout the course, you will work on real-world datasets and practical examples to gain hands-on experience with the NumPy and Pandas libraries. By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use NumPy and Pandas to process and analyze data effectively.
